every 20sec water_level drop by 1

dropWaterLevel()
	every drop_rate decrease water by 1

if water_level === 0
	change alive to false

if growth_stage === max_growth
	plant reached max growth
	can no longer die
	everything stop

a user log in,
	time_now = we grab time now

when was the last event user took action
	grab that time
	check how much time have passed

time_passed divide drop_rate
	subtract from water_level


if water was 80%

 water is 40% when user logged in 

80% - growth_limit(50%) = 30%

30% * waterDrop_rate = 600000
	60000 / 20000 = 30

30 * growth_stage

water is 40%
